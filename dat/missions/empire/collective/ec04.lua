The silhouette of the transport ship is barely visible. As you fly closer, it becomes apparent that they were detected and massacred. You see if you can salvage the readings from their equipment, but it seems like it's completely toasted.]]

   You've got one, right?]]

"No survivors, eh? I had that gut feeling. At least you were able to salvage something? Good, at least it'll make their deaths not be completely futile. Meet me in the bar in a while. We're going to try to process this datapad. It'll hopefully have the final results."]]
