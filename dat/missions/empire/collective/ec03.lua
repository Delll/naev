"It looks like you got something. It's not very clear because of %s's atmosphere creating a lot of noise, but it does seem to be similar to Empire transmissions. We've got another plan to try for a cleaner signal. It'll be uglier then the last one. You in?"]]

"The idea would be to have you fly deep into Collective territory and start causing disturbances. This is no suicide missio, so you'll have to fly back when things start getting ugly. Meanwhile we'll send a fast convoy with the commandos to %s, to start monitoring."]]

"Good luck and be careful out there," he adds, before saluting you off onto your mission.]]

"How was the trip? I trust you didn't have too many issues evading the Collective. We won't hear from the commandos until 10 STU from now when they get back, but I believe everything went well."
"Stay alert. We'll probably need your assistance when they get back. Take the free time as a vacation. I heard the weather on Caladan is pretty nice this time of year, maybe you should visit them. We'll keep in touch."]]
