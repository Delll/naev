They're a recent menace; had the timing to arrive more or less when the Incident occured, otherwise they would have been wiped out by the Emperor's Armada without a sweat. They completely wiped out all human life in Eiroik, and the other worlds they hit. We managed to stop them here, in %s, and constructed this base. Since then it's been more or less a stalemate."]]
