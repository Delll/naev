"Hello, I'm Lieutenant Czesc from the Empire Armada Shipping Division. We're having another recruitment operation and would be interested in having another pilot among us. Would be interesting in working for the Empire?"]]

Later on, you could get called upon for more important missions. Who knows? You could be the next Yao Pternov, greatest pilot we ever had in the armada."
He hits a couple buttons on his wrist computer, which springs into action.
"It looks like we already have a simple task for you. Deliver these parcels to %s. The best pilots started delivering papers and ended up flying into combat against gigantic warships with the Interception Division."]]
   text[3] = [[You deliver the parcels to the Empire Shipping station at the %s spaceport. Afterwards, they make you do some paperwork to formalise your participation with the Empire. They tell you to keep an eye out for missions labeled ES, which stands for Empire Shipping, in the mission computer, to which you now have access.
You aren't too sure of what to make of your encounter with the Empire. Only time will tell...]]
