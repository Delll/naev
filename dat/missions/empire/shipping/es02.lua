They managed to escape, but the engine ended up giving out in the %s system. The ship is now disabled and we need someone to board the ship and rescue the VIP. There have been many FLF ships detected near the sector, but we've managed to organise a Dvaered escort for you."

His survival is vital."]]

Hopefully they'll start offering you work too. We have nothing more for you now, but check in periodically in case something comes up for you."]]
